First things first: I really like Twitter. I actually spend way to much time on it. Different to other though, i very rarely interact with people as i didn't see the
value of sharing my opinion nor the need to dismiss others (different to real, personal conversations in which i absolutely do this). There are specific reasons why
i don't like to interact on Twitter, and i want to lay them out here. 

I think Twitter is a incredibly important plattform for western societies. Journalists, Politicians, Artist, they all at least are present, if not active, on Twitter. 
And as a consequence, Twitter is showing, influencing and shaping public opinion and decision making like few other websites. It is precicely because of this impact, that i doubt that Twitter really is a force to shape
society into a better place. And to make that clear in the beginning: I think this is neither fully the fault of Twitter nor the people on the platform. But i do think
that many people use the plattform wrong by missinterpreting it as something that it is not: Twitter is NOT a plattform for discussion. Twitter is a plattform to share
you already existing opinion with others. Twitter is NOT a great plattform to do politics. It is a plattform to find people and articles that let you inform yourself
about politics. Nothing actually smart has ever been said in 128 or 256 characters. Actual insights require context, consideration and moderation. Nothing of this possible on Twitter.
Therefore, if you use Twitter for somethings that does not require these things, you are using it absolutely correct: 
- Sharing links to articles, blog entries or websites which put in the work to provide context
- Memes or cat-videos, which probably work better without context 
- Personal achievements or updates 
- A snappy comedic one-liner, which by definition are only funny until you start explaining them.

But let's start by actually providing the kind of context i just demanded, and let me explain what's wrong about current Twitter culture with three examples:
