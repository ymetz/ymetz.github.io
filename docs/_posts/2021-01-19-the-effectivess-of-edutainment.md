Like many, i really enjoy Science and educational content on Youtube. I still find myself drawn to many of the old guard of Veritasium, Vsauce, CGP Grey, but also
enjoy videos from Kurzgesagt, Wendover, exurb1a, Wisecrack, maiLab ... You name it. And after thinking about it... i started to questions how much of what i watch actually STICKS.
I mean, the desire to learn something definitely is at least part of the motivation of watching these channels, and the prospect of making educational content is the
main selling point of these channels. So my question is: Is it actually more than entertainment. Do i learn something from these videos? In order to get an answer, i actually started
a little self-experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of these videos for me. But if there is at least one thing i know about science, it's that anecdodal evidence is not
sufficient to make any reliable claims. So what can actual science tell me about this? Turns out, i'm not the first one to ask myself this question.
