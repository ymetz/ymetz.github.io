Welcome to my blog.


To state the obvious:  Yes, I seem just like another ML tech dude, paired with an optimistic look into the future, we're fine-attitude and entrepreneurial spirit. And let's be honest: That is pretty much true.
On the other hand, I would claim to bring the right amount of disillusionment, lacking self-confidence, and outsider view to the table. Thus I hope I can provide some fresh takes.
I guess it's only fair then to accompany this spirit with both grounded and completely unrealistic goals for this blog:
- Presenting interesting ideas and perspectives influenced by my work and research.
- Commenting on recent developments in machine learning/artificial intelligence or data science in a broader societal context
- Assemble survey-like blog post on interesting questions in ML (somewhat in the spirit of the great [Lil'Log](https://lilianweng.github.i "Lil'Log")) 
- More informal than an actual paper, but still with aspirations of scientific rigor.
- Experimenting with custom, interactive visualizations (d3.js or similar) or custom visualizations in general
- Get to a point, where this is not just me applying the Feynman technique (although that is the main idea at this point)

What else is there to say other than I hope you enjoy it and let there be posts that anyone can enjoy.

Cheers.
