My name is Yannick. I am a PhD student in computer science at the University of Konstanz.
I'm interested in machine learning (in particular deep reinforcement learning), but more general human-AI interaction via interactive user interfaces and visualisations.
I like to work at the intersection between machine learning, human-computer interaction and software engineering. You find a selection of my projects, that i either performed or collaborated on with others on this page.

I studied computer science at Konstanz, Germany and Uppsala, Sweden, and reiceved a M.Sc degree in computer science from Konstanz in 2021. During my studies, i worked on topics such as adversarial attacks on neural networks, explaianble AI via concept-based explanations, and using visual analytics to support imitation and reinforcement learning. Outside of the unversity, i enjoy playing the piano, reading, hiking, and playing Badminton.

Hope you enjoy. 

Cheers.
