My name is Yannick. I am a Masters student in computer science at the University of Konstanz.
I'm interested in machine learning, sequential decision making and data analysis and visualization.

Here, i will present both personal projects and thoughts, and hopefully an interesting blog on topics in AI, technology and data science (I know what you are thinking: That's the most innovative idea ever!). My goal for the blog to one of the 100.000 best and most informative blogs on the internet. Hope you enjoy it. 

Cheers.
